# Seven Bridges

## **About Seven Bridges**

_BDC-Seven Bridges_ offers researchers collaborative workspaces for analyzing genomics data at scale. Researchers can find and analyze the hosted TOPMed studies by using hundreds of optimized analysis tools and workflows (pipelines); creating their own workflows; or interactive analysis. On the platform, researchers can utilize collaborative workspaces for analyzing genomics data at scale, and access hosted datasets along with Common Workflow Language (CWL) and GENESIS R package pipelines for analysis. This platform also enables users to bring their own data for analysis and work in RStudio and Jupyterlab Notebooks for interactive analysis.

### **Key Features**

* Private, secure, workspaces (projects) for running analyses at scale
* Collaboration features with the ability to set granular permissions on project members
* Direct access to BDC without needing to set up a Google or AWS billing account
* Access hosted TOPMed studies all in one place and analyze data on the cloud at scale
* Tools and features for performing multiple-variant and single-variant association studies including:
  * Annotation Explorer for variant aggregations
  * Cloud-optimized Genesis R package workflows in Common Workflow Language
* Cohort creation by searching phenotype data
  * Use PIC-SURE API for searching phenotype data
  * Search by known dbGaP identifiers
* Rstudio and Jupyterlab Notebooks built directly into the platform for easy interactive analysis and manipulation of phenotype data
* Hosted TOPMed data you can combine with your own data on AWS or Google Cloud
* Billing and administrative controls to help your research funding go furthe&#x72;**:** avoid forgotten instances, abort infinite loops, get usage breakdowns by project.
