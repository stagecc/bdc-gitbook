# Billing

Now that you can log in, you’ll want to make sure that you have access to a Billing Account and Billing Project. This will allow you to charge storage and analysis costs through a Google account linked to Terra. A Terra Billing Project is Terra's way of connecting a workspace where you accrue costs for things, back to a Google Billing account where you pay for it. You must have a Google Billing Account established before creating a Terra Billing Project. Outlined here are the steps necessary to set this up, as well as instructions on how to add or be added to an existing account/billing project.

Detailed instructions for setting up your billing can be found by following the links below. If you are a BDC Fellow, your procedure for billing set up is a bit different, but you may find some of the information below still relevant (sharing a billing project with another user, for example).\
