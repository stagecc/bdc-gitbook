# Batch Processing with Workflows

The batch workflow features of Terra provide support for computationally-intensive, long-running, and large-scale analysis.

You can perform whole pipelines—from preprocessing and trimming sequencing data to alignment and downstream analyses—using Terra workflows. Written in the human-readable Workflow Description Language ([WDL](https://openwdl.org/)), you can search for and import workflows into your workspace from [Dockstore](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/analyze-data/dockstore) or the [Broad Methods Repository](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360025674392).
