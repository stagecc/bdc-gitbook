# Run Analyses

Terra supports the following types of analysis: Batch processing with Workflows and Interactive analysis with Jupyter Notebooks. This section will orient you with resources that teach you how to do:

* [Batch processing with workflows](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/analyze-data/terra/running-analyses-on-terra/batch-processing-with-workflows)
* [Interactive analysis with Jupyter Notebooks](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/analyze-data/terra/running-analyses-on-terra/interactive-analysis-with-jupyter-notebooks)
* [Genome-wide association studies](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/analyze-data/terra/running-analyses-on-terra/genome-wide-association-studies)

As an introduction, we recommend reading our article on the [kinds of analysis you can do in Terra](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360022714931). &#x20;
