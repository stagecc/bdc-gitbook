# Bring Data into a Workspace

You can import data into your workspace by either linking directly to external files you have access to, or by interfacing with a number of platforms with which Terra has integrated access.&#x20;

For BDC researchers, one of the most relevant of these interfacing platforms is [Gen3](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/explore_data/gen3-discovering-data). However this section also provides you with resources that teach how to import data from other public datasets integrated into Terraâ€™s data library, as well as how to bring in your own data.
