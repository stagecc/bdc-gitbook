# Use Your Own Data with Terra

This page describes how researchers may bring their own data files and metadata into Terra. Some researchers may choose to bring their own data to Terra in addition to - or instead of - using BDC data from Gen3. For example, this may be done when bringing additional (e.g., longitudinal) phenotypic data to enhance the harmonized metadata available from Gen3, or when using Joint variant calling with additional researcher provided genomic data, or even using researcher provided data exclusively,

Generally, there are two types of data that researchers typically bring to Terra. Data files (e.g., genomic data, including CRAM and VCF data), and metadata (e.g., tables of clinical/phenotypic or other data, typically regarding the subjects in their study). These are described separately below.\


There are two ways a researcher's data files may be made available in Terra: By uploading data to the researcher's workspace bucket or enabling Terra to access the researcher's data in a researcher managed Google bucket, for which you need to set up a proxy group.

The ways in which a researcher may import metadata to the Terra Data tables are described in the​ articles and tutorials below:
