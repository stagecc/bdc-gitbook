# From Terra’s Data Library

Terra’s [Dataset Library](https://terra.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/#library/datasets) includes a number of integrated datasets, many of which have individualized Data Explorer interfaces, useful for generating and exporting custom cohorts. If you click into a dataset and have the proper permissions,  you'll be able to explore the data. If you don't have the necessary permission, you'll be taken to a page that tells you whom to contact for access. &#x20;

​The resources linked below provide guided instructions for creating custom cohorts from the data library and importing them to your workspace, and using a Jupyter notebook to interact with the data:\
