# Launch workflows with BDC

Using the BDC ecosystem, you can launch workflows from Dockstore in both of our partner analysis platforms, Terra and SevenBridges. It is important to know that these platforms use different workflow languages: Terra uses WDL and SevenBridges uses CWL.&#x20;

When you open any WDL and CWL workflow in Dockstore, you will see the option to "Launch with NHLBI BioData Catalyst":&#x20;

* If you selected a CWL workflow, this workflow will launch in _BDC Powered by Seven Bridges (BDC-Seven Bridges)_. [Learn more about how this integration works.](https://sb-biodatacatalyst.readme.io/docs/import-a-dockstore-app)
* If you selected a WDL workflow, this workflow will launch in _BDC Powered by Terra (BDC-Terra)_.
