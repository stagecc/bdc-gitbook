# TOPMed and TOPMed related datasets

The BDC ecosystem hosts several datasets from the [NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program](https://topmed.nhlbi.nih.gov/). The PIC-SURE platform has integrated the clinical and genomic data from all studies listed in the Data Access Dashboard. _Through the ingestion process, occasionally PIC-SURE will ingest phenotypic data for the TOPMed studies prior to the genomic data._

## **Harmonized Data (TOPMed Harmonized Clinical Variables)**

There are limited amounts of harmonized data available at this time. The TOPMed Data Coordinating Center (DCC) curation team has identified 44 variables that are shared across 17 NHLBI studies and normalized the participant values for these variables.

The 44 harmonized variables available are listed in the table in Appendix 2. For more information on this initiative, you can view the [additional documentation from the TOPMed DCC GitHub repository](https://github.com/UW-GAC/topmed-dcc-harmonized-phenotypes) or on the [NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine website](https://topmed.nhlbi.nih.gov/dcc-harmonized-phenotypes).
