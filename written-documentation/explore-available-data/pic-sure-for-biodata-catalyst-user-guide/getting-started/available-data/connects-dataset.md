# CONNECTS Dataset

The BDC ecosystem hosts several datasets from the [NIH NHLBI Collaborating Network of Networks for Evaluating COVID-19 and Therapeutic Strategies (CONNECTS) program](https://nhlbi-connects.org/about). These COVID-19 related studies follow the guidelines for implementing common data elements (CDEs) and for de-identifying dates, ages, and free text fields. For more information about these efforts, you can view the CDE Manual and De-Identification Guidance documents on the [CONNECTS COVID-19 Therapeutic Trial Common Data Elements webpage](https://nhlbi-connects.org/common_data_elements).
