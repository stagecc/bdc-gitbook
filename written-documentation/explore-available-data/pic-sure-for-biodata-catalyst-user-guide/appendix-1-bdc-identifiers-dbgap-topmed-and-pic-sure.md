| \\\_Parent Study Accession with Subject ID\\               | <p>Generated identifier for PARENT Studies. In most studies this follows the same pattern as the TOPMed Study Accession with Subject id.</p><p> </p><p>However, Framingham’s parent study phs000007 does not contain SUBJECT_ID column which is replaced using the SHAREID column.</p><p> </p><p>Eg: phs000007.v3_XXXXXXX</p> |
| \\\_VCF Sample Id\\                                        | <p>This variable is stored in the sample multi file in each dbGaP study.</p><p> </p><p>This is the TOPMed DNA sample identifier. This is used to give each sample/sequence a unique identifier across TOPMed studies.</p><p> </p><p>Eg: NWD123456</p>                                                                         |
| Patient ID (not a concept path but exists in data exports) | <p>This is PIC-SURE’s internal Identifier. It is commonly referred to as HPDS Patient num.</p><p> </p><p>This identifier is generated and assigned to subjects when they are loaded. It is not meant for data correlation between different data sources.</p>                                                                 |
