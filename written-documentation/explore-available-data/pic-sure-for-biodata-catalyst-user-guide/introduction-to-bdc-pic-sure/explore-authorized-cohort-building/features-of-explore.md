## Features of Explore

The Explore page provides access to complete, participant-level data, in addition to aggregate counts. There are some features specific to the Explore page, outlined below.

**A: Faceted search.** The panel on the left-hand side of the screen provides options, or facets, to narrow down your search results.

**B: Search bar.** The search bar at the top center of the page allows for searching of phenotypes, clinical outcomes, and variables of interest.

**C. Search results table.** The search results table displays the variables that are returned based on the combination of search term and selected facets.

**D. Actions for filtering variables.** Information about icons from left to right:

* The Information icon allows you to view information associated with the variable.
* The Filter icon allows you to apply a variable-level filter.
* The Hierarchy icon allows you to apply filters on different nodes within that variable's concept path. For example, let's say we click the hierarchy icon of the `HFAA23I1. Orthopnea at discharge [Heart Failure Hospital Record Abstraction Form, HFA]` variable. This will show the concept path for the variable: the study (ARIC), table (pht004102), and variable level. We can click on the table "pht004102" level to add a filter that selects participants with data associated with any variables in that table.
* The Add to Export icon allows you to add variables to the export. Note that this will not apply any filtering to these variables.

**E. Genomic Filtering.** The Genomic Filtering button can be used to apply genomic filters to your cohort selection criteria. For more information about genomic filtering, please refer to the [Genomic Filtering section](genomic-filtering.md).

**F. Participant counts in the Results Panel.** The count displayed will be updated to describe the number of participants who meet the query criteria.

**C: Prepare for Analysis.** Once at least one filter has been added, the Prepare for Analysis button can be used to retrieve participant-level data corresponding to your filters and variable selections. To learn more about data retrieval options, please refer to the [Prepare for Analysis section](prepare-for-analysis/).

**H. Build Advanced Query.** Enables researchers to create complex queries by defining logical operators ("and" vs. "or") and grouping related filters. For more information, please refer to the [Building Advanced Queries section](../building-advanced-queries.md).

**G. Variable Distributions Tool.** Use this tool to view distributions graphs for the selected cohort. Continuous data will be shown as histograms while categorical variables will be shown as bar plots.
