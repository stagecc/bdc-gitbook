### API key(s)

To download large amounts of data, an API key will be required as a part of the [gen3-client](https://gen3.org/resources/user/gen3-client/). To create a key on your local machine, click **Create API key**, which will activate the following pop-up window:

Click **Download json** to save the credential file to your local machine. After completion, a new entry will appear in the API key(s) section of the Profile page. It will display the API key `key_id` and the expiration date (one month after the key creation). The user should delete the key after it has expired. If for any reason a user feels that their API key has been compromised, the key should be deleted before subsequently creating a new one.

### Project Access

This section of the Profile page lists the projects and the methods of access for the data within in the _BDC-Gen3_ system. If you do not see access to a specific study, check that you have been granted access within [dbGaP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/). If access has been granted for over a week, contact the BDC Help Desk: bdcat-support@datacommons.io
