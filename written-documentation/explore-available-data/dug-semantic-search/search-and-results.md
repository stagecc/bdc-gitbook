# Search and Results

1. Navigate to [https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/use-bdc/explore-data/dug/](https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/use-bdc/explore-data/dug/) to access Dug Semantic Search.&#x20;
2. Semantic search is a concept-based search engine designed for users to search biomedical concepts, such as “asthma,” “lung,” or “fever,” and the variables related to and/or used to measure them. For example, a search for “chronic pain acceptance” will return a list of related biomedical concepts, such as chronic pain, headaches, neuralgia, or fibromyalgia, each of which can be expanded to display related variables and CDEs. Semantic search can also find variable names and descriptions directly, using synonyms from its knowledge graphs to find search-related variables.
3. Enter a search term and press “Enter,” or click on the Search button. This will take you to the Semantic Search interface.
