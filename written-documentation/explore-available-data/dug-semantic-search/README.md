# Dug Semantic Search

## Overview

Dug Semantic Search is a tool that allows users to deep dive into BDC studies and biomedical topics, research, and publications to identify related studies, datasets, and variables. If you are interested in how Dug connects study variables to biomedical concepts, [read the Dug paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/38/12/3252/6571145) or visit the[ Help Portal](http://bit.ly/HEALSemanticSearch_Help).

This tool applies semantic web and knowledge graph techniques to improve BDC research data Findability, Access, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR). Through this process, semantic search helps users identify novel relations, build unique research questions, and identify potential collaborations.
