# 2025-01-15 NHLBI BioData Catalyst Ecosystem Release Notes

### **Introduction**

The 2025-01-15 release marks the 20th release for the NHLBI BioData CatalystÂ® (BDC) ecosystem. This release includes several new features (e.g., storage cost savings and PFB handoff of cohort data) along with documentation and tutorials (e.g., video guides to BDC Data Studio environments) to help new users get started on the system. This release also includes enhanced support for working with cohort data. Please find more detail on the new features and user support materials in the sections below.

The 2025-01-15 data releases include the addition of studies on pulmonary fibrosis, COPD, asthma, and congenital heart defects, along with new imaging from atherosclerosis and echocardiogram studies. Updates also include research on cardiovascular health, genetic epidemiology, COVID-19, blood pressure, veteran health, and lifestyle interventions. Please refer to the Data Releases section below for more information as well as the[ Data page](https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/data) on the BDC website.

### **Significant new features**

**Save on storage costs in Terra with bucket lifecycle rules:** This feature on _BDC Powered by Terra (BDC-Terra)_ gives users better controls to delete unnecessary workspace bucket files and manage cloud storage costs. [Learn more about bucket lifecycle rules here.](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/31182203937179-Save-storage-costs-with-bucket-lifecycle-rules-Released-12-6-24)

**PFB Handoff of Cohort Data from PIC-SURE to Terra:** After exploring data and adding filters to build a cohort of interest in _BDC Powered by PIC-SURE (BDC-PIC-SURE)_, investigators can now seamlessly move the participant-level data to _BDC-Terra_ for analysis. This feature allows investigators to bring the data into a new or previously existing _BDC-Terra_ workspace using the Portable Format for Bioinformatics, or PFB, format. This format includes two tables: the participant-level data and the associated data dictionary. [Learn more about handing off participant data from _BDC-PIC-SURE_ to _BDC-Terra_ here](https://pic-sure.gitbook.io/nhlbi-biodata-catalyst-powered-by-pic-sure/explore/features-of-explore/pfb-handoff-to-biodata-catalyst-powered-by-terra) and at [_BDC-Terra Support_](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/31787224295579-How-to-create-and-export-a-PIC-SURE-cohort).

**Links to Original Files from Selected Cohort Data:** The selected participant-level data from _BDC-PIC-SURE_ is now connected back to the original data file. The data is connected using DRS URIs, a GA4GH standard used to allow access to data in a single, standard way. This allows investigators to refer back to the original source of the _BDC-PIC-SURE_ data. This feature is currently available in the data dictionary table with the PFB formatted _BDC-PIC-SURE_ data. Note: This is currently available for some studies, but the DRS URIs of other studies are being added regularly.

**Connect Cohort Data to Genomic Information via Sample Identifiers:** Investigators can automatically include sample identifiers when preparing selected cohort data for analysis in _BDC-PIC-SURE_. The sample identifiers allow researchers to connect the phenotypic information to the associated genomic data or other sample types. [Learn more about including sample identifiers here.](https://pic-sure.gitbook.io/nhlbi-biodata-catalyst-powered-by-pic-sure/explore/features-of-explore/prepare-for-analysis)

**Explore Data with Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) Gravity Domains:** Several variables from BDC data have been mapped to SDOH domains from the Gravity Project, a collaborative public-private initiative with the goal of developing consensus-driven data standards to support the collection, use, and exchange of data to address SDOH. These mappings can be used to explore the data in _BDC-PIC-SURE_.&#x20;

### **New user support materials and documentation**

**Video guides to BDC Data Studio Environments:** Three new onboarding videos were created to introduce and orient users to the three kinds of Data Studio environments available on BDC: JupyterLab, RStudio, and SAS Studio. These videos are available on the [Velsera YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHYRY81C1euhlIMdf0OPYiWhWAnZSdAnZ) as platform-generated videos.

### **Data Releases**

The table below highlights which studies were included in the 2025-01-15 data release.

The latest release features NHLBI TOPMed projects, including the San Antonio Family Heart Study (SAFHS), Women's Health Initiative (WHI), and the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Whole Genome Sequencing Project, with updates from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS). New additions include the study of African Americans, Asthma, Genes, and Environment (SAGE), the Pulmonary Fibrosis Whole Genome Sequencing project, and the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD (COPDGene). Furthermore, the release highlights studies on the Molecular Genetics of Heterotaxy and Related Congenital Heart Defects, and the Collaborative Cohort of Cohorts for COVID-19 Research (C4R) with data from SPIROMICS and Jackson Heart Study (JHS). Featured are several BioLINCC studies, such as the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), Heart Failure Network studies, and the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC). This release introduces the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Echocardiogram Image Repository and includes data from the Veterans Administration (VA) Million Veteran Program (MVP) as well as the Healthy Lifestyle Program (HeLP).

The data is now available for access across the entire ecosystem.
