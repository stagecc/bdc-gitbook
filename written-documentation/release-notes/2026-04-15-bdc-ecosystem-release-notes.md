# 2026-04-15 BDC Ecosystem Release Notes

### Introduction

The 2026-04-15 release marks the 25th update to the BDC ecosystem. This release introduces several new features, including expanded data access, new interoperability tools, enhanced compute capabilities, and new bioinformatics workflows.

The 2026-04-15 data releases include the addition of 90 new datasets. See the Data Releases section below for more information.

### Significant new features&#x20;

The following new features were released this quarter to improve the researcher experience:

#### BDC Powered by Seven Bridges (BDC-Seven Bridges)

* Enhanced File Browser Improvements: Improvements have been made to the new File Browser to increase the limit to 1,000 items when selecting items for download. Navigation has been updated to provide a smoother and more consistent experience by returning the user to the new File Browser after adding files from the data menu, faceted search, and DRS manifest instead of directing to the old Files tab.
* Dynamic Portable Format for Bioinformatics (PFB) Importer Introduced: This new release enables end-to-end seamless BDC-Gen3 to BDC-Seven Bridges data imports with reliable schema expansion (the ability to accommodate new or unexpected types of data) and preserved source study folder structures.
* Graphical User Interface (GUI)-Based Imaging Workflows: Data Studio now supports OHIF Viewer, 3D Slicer, and ImageJ allowing users to select and open image files directly from the Files tab in a Data Studio session. These applications are also available when creating a new analysis directly through Data Studio. This represents a significant added feature as users now have access to advanced visualization and annotation workflows for imaging data and custom extension and plugins can be installed and persist upon session restart. Annotated outputs and results files from these imaging tools can be exported back to a user’s project and used in downstream analysis applications.

#### BDC Powered by PIC-SURE (BDC-PIC-SURE)&#x20;

* No significant new features this quarter.

#### BDC Powered by Terra (BDC-Terra)&#x20;

* Interactive Analysis: BDC-Terra has published a new lean base docker image for cloud environments. This image also grants sudo permission when used as a base for custom Docker environments. See article for more details: [Easily build, customize, and reuse compute environments (Jupyter Notebooks) - Launching 1/16/26](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/31191625622811)
* Workflows: BDC-Terra has made the following updates to workflows:
* Users can now use WDL 1.1.
* Fixed an issue that could cause workflows to run slowly or not complete when utilizing Terra's lifecycle rules to move files to submissions/final-outputs.
* When running a workflow against a set of entities in a data table and generating an array value for WDL input, elements of that array now respect the order in which they were entered in the data table set.

#### BDC Powered by Gen3 (BDC-Gen3)&#x20;

* No significant new features this quarter.
