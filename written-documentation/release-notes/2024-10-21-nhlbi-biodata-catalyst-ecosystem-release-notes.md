# 2024-10-21 NHLBI BioData Catalyst Ecosystem Release Notes

### **Introduction**

The 2024-10-21 release marks the 19th release for the NHLBI BioData Catalyst® (BDC) ecosystem. This release includes several new features (e.g., supporting _seqr_ genomics analysis, and exporting selected cohort data in PFB format). Please find more detail on the new features in the sections below.

The 2024-10-21 data releases include the addition of studies on asthma and sickle cell disease, plus new imaging from cardiovascular and atherosclerosis studies. Updates are highlighted for COPD, atrial fibrillation, and childhood asthma studies, and new additions include liver disease, myocardial genomics, and exRNA studies. The release also introduces the RECOVER-Pediatric project and the REDS-IV-P Epidemiology of COVID-19 study. Please refer to the Data Releases section below for more information as well as the [Data page](https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/data) on the BDC website.

### **Significant new features**

_BDC Powered by Terra (BDC-Terra)_ now supports _seqr_ genomics analysis: _seqr_ provides rich gene and variant-level annotations and powerful filtration tools to perform variant searches within a family or across projects. To get started, check out the [video](https://cmg.broadinstitute.org/using-seqr) tutorials, including a video describing how to load your data in _seqr_.

Export selected cohort data in Portable Format for Biomedical Data (PFB): _BDC Powered by PIC-SURE (BDC-PIC-SURE)_ now allows researchers to export selected participant-level data in PFB file format. When using the Select and Package Data tool in Authorized PIC-SURE, simply choose “Package Data as PFB” to export in this file format.

### **Data Releases**

The table below highlights which studies were included in the 2024-10-21 data release.

The latest release features NHLBI TOPMed projects such as the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP) and Pharmacogenomics of Hydroxyurea in Sickle Cell Disease (PharmHU). Additionally, it includes new imaging XML schemas from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Updates are also highlighted in the Boston Early-Onset COPD Study, Cleveland Clinic Atrial Fibrillation Study, and the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP). New additions include the Human Liver Cohort and studies on myocardial genomics and exRNA profiles. The release also introduces the RECOVER-Pediatric project and the REDS-IV-P Epidemiology of COVID-19 study.

The data is now available for access across the entire ecosystem.
