# 2025-04-15 BDC Release Notes

## Introduction

The 2025-04-15 release marks the 21st release for the NHLBI BioData Catalyst® (BDC) ecosystem. This release includes several new features (e.g., cloud cost estimator, PFB’s w/reference to raw files, and updates to cost monitoring workflows) along with documentation and tutorials (e.g., Publicly available coding examples for PIC-SURE on Terra) to help new users get started on the system. Please find more detail on the new features and user support materials in the sections below.

The 2025-04-15 data releases include the addition of Genes-Environments, Genomic Activities, Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities, Pulmonary Fibrosis, Molecular Atlas of Lung Development, Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER), Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction, Acute Respiratory Distress, COVID-19, Resuscitation Outcomes, Sedation Titration for Respiratory Failure, Study of Congestive Heart Failure, Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury. Please refer to the Data Releases section below for more information as well as the[ Data page](https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/data) on the BDC website.

## Significant new features

Velsera added cloud cost estimators for two additional workflows, samtools mpileup (tool used on BAM files in variant calling workflows), and samtools index (tool used to index BAM, CRAM or BGZIP-compressed SAM files). These calculators enable users to better estimate their cloud costs before running the analysis and incurring the charges. They bring the total number of tools and workflows with cost calculators to 10.

Gen3 team extended the data ingestion process to include the creation and persistence of PFBs containing references to each dataset's raw files. Gen3 Discovery Page was also extended to show these PFBs and allow them to be handed off to an analysis platform.  This feature helps end users who want quick, easy access to the full dataset's original information by providing an interface in the existing Gen3 Discovery Page to see the PFBs. Data can be made available quickly without waiting for harmonized ingestion. Improves data provenance by keeping and making available the original, raw data.

Gen3 team created the ability for a user to obtain full, harmonized, study-level data as PFBs from the Discovery Page without having to generate them.  This eliminates the time consuming, dynamic generation of cohorts when the user simply wants the whole dataset. The handoff of the ready available whole-study PFB can be easily done from the Discovery page to the analysis platform.

Terra has made several improvements for cost monitoring workflows. Terra now has the ability to show [cost reporting in real time](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/34942283363611-March-14-2025) for workflows submitted after 3/3/25 and users can now test setting [workflow cost thresholds](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/31269696049307-Set-workflow-cost-thresholds-Launching-by-5-7-25) to avoid accidentally cost overruns.&#x20;

### **New user support materials and documentation**

Publicly available coding examples for PIC-SURE on Terra: The publicly available coding examples to get started exploring data and building participant-level cohorts with the PIC-SURE application programming interface has moved on Terra. These new workspaces contain updated code and documentation. Researchers can access the examples at the following links to Terra: [Python notebooks](https://terra.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/#workspaces/biodata-catalyst/BDC-PIC-SURE%20API%20Python%20Examples), [R notebooks](https://terra.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/#workspaces/biodata-catalyst/BDC-PIC-SURE%20API%20R%20Examples), and [RStudio](https://terra.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/#workspaces/biodata-catalyst/BDC-PIC-SURE%20API%20RStudio%20Examples).&#x20;
