# 2024-07-02 NHLBI BioData Catalyst Ecosystem Release Notes

### **Introduction**

The 2024-07-02 release marks the 18th release for the NHLBI BioData CatalystÂ® (BDC) ecosystem. This release includes several new features (e.g., an expanded workflow cost estimator, cascading authorization from parent to child studies, and DOIs at the dataset level). Please find more detail on the new features and user support materials in the sections below.

The 2024-07-02 data releases include the addition of research on atrial fibrillation, asthma, sickle cell disease, atherosclerosis, and more. Please refer to the Data Releases section below for more information as well as the[ Data page](https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/data) on the BDC website.

### **Significant new features**

**Fixed Interoperability on BioData Catalyst Powered By Seven Bridges (BDC-Seven Bridges):** BDC-Seven Bridges completed work on updating interoperability functionality. The initial release of the project-based data download restriction functionality inadvertently interfered with DRS data interoperability between BDC-Seven Bridges and other ecosystems such as CAVATICA. This unintentionally re-siloed data on those systems and runs counter to the overarching NIH data ecosystem goals of making data available to users across NIH institute/system boundaries.

**Workflow Cost Estimator Expansion:** A feature that enables users to estimate analysis costs before running has been expanded to three new workflows on BDC-Seven Bridges: 1) **Cyrius**, a tool to genotype CYP2D6 from WGS BAM or CRAM files, 2) **kallisto quant**, a tool to quantify RNA-seq data, and 3) **BEDTools Coverage**, a tool that computes both the depth and breadth of coverage of features in file B on the features in file A, useful for comparing WGS files. Users can filter tools based on the interactive cost estimator. [See here for documentation](https://sb-biodatacatalyst.readme.io/docs/estimate-task-costs).

**Support Cascading authorization from dbGaP parent to child studies:** Gen3 has updated the authorization process in BDC to enable a researcher with access to a dbGaP parent study to automatically gain access to relevant child studies. The authorization process as it existed previously in BDC expected dbGaP to explicitly grant access to both parent and its associated substudies individually. Since dbGaP did not provide explicit access for child studies, users were not able to access these child studies without additional authorization requested manually. With the implementation of support for cascading of authorization from parent to child study, a researcher with access to a dbGaP parent study will also gain access to relevant child studies in BDC, eliminating the need for any manual authorization process.

**Implementation of DOIs at Dataset level:** A digital object identifier (DOI) is a persistent identifier or handle used to identify objects uniquely, standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). In BDC, DOIs have been created and made available at the dataset level to assign a persistent identifier in a standard format. The DOIs are available via the Gen3 discovery page as well as the API. DataCite was used as the registration service. Going forward, every BDC dataset will have a DOI minted as part of the data ingestion process. For a user, having assigned DOIs to datasets will promote research reproducibility and data FAIR-ness.

**View Stigmatizing Variables in PIC-SURE Open Access:** Researchers can now view all variables, including stigmatizing variables, that are relevant to their search. Though these variables are not filterable in Open Access to protect participant data, this allows researchers to better understand what information is present in BDC. For more information about stigmatizing variables, please visit the [publicly available GitHub repository](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/biodata_catalyst_stigmatizing_variables).

### **Data Releases**

The table below highlights which studies were included in the 2024-07-02 data release.

The latest release includes studies from NHLBI TOPMed projects such as Partners HealthCare Biobank, Novel Risk Factors for the Development of Atrial Fibrillation in Women, and the Study of Asthma Phenotypes and Pharmacogenomic Interactions by Race-Ethnicity (SAPPHIRE). New versions of studies like Walk-PHaSST Sickle Cell Disease, the Malmo Preventive Project, and the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Atrial Fibrillation Genetics Study are also featured. Additionally, the release includes updates to studies like Outcome Modifying Genes in Sickle Cell Disease (OMG) and the Vanderbilt University BioVU Atrial Fibrillation Genetics Study. The Collaborative Cohort of Cohorts for COVID-19 Research (C4R) and NIH RECOVER projects are also part of this release, including studies from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.

The data is now available for access across the entire ecosystem.
