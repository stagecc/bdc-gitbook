# 2020-08-24 BioData Catalyst Ecosystem Release Notes

### Introduction

The 2020-08-24 release marks the second release for the NHLBI BioData Catalyst ecosystem. This release includes several new features along with documentation and tutorials (e.g. genome-wide association studies) to help new users get started on the system. This release also includes enhanced support for machine learning in the workspace environments and support for GA4GH industry standard in Dockstore for workflows. Please find more detail on the new features and user support materials in the sections below.

The 2020-08-24 data release includes the addition of TOPMed Freeze 8 data for a subset of studies on BioData Catalyst. Freeze8 multi-sample VCFs are available for 29 studies, of which 10 studies are new to the ecosystem. For each study and consent group, VCF files are available on a per chromosome basis and in an un-tarred format, in contrast to the Freeze5 multi-sample VCFs which are hosted as tar bundles. For the 10 studies new to BioData Catalyst, CRAM files and unharmonized clinical files are also available for access. The data release further includes updates of many studies to the latest versions that are available on dbGaP. The next data release will include Freeze8 multi-sample VCFs for additional TOPMed studies in addition to unharmonized clinical data and CRAM files for studies that are not yet hosted on the system. Please refer to the Data Release section below for more information as well as the[ Data page](https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/data) on the BioData Catalyst website.

### Significant new features

* **GENESIS tutorial and public project:** Seven Bridges has made a public project available that introduces users to the GENESIS R package and related R packages (SeqArray, SeqVarTools, and SNPRelate) used in mixed model association testing in sequence data. The examples in the project help users understand the code that is used in the GENESIS public apps ([available on GitHub](https://uw-gac.github.io/SISG_2020/)), prepare data for input to those apps, and interact with the results. The “GENESIS Tutorial” public project can be found in the list of Seven Bridges public projects on the top navigation bar of the platform. \

* **Launch machine learning packages in Jupyterlab Notebooks:** Users on Seven Bridges can now use a docker image with[ pre-installed libraries](https://sb-biodatacatalyst.readme.io/v1.0/docs/about-libraries-in-a-data-cruncher-analysis) that support machine learning analyses when working in Jupyterlab Notebooks. This docker image can be found in the Data Cruncher feature: Select “Create new analysis” and then, under the Environment setup menu, select “SB Machine Learning - TensorFlow 2.0, Python 3.7.”\

* **Support for larger GPU instances:** A larger[ AWS GPU instance type](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p3/) is now available for researchers working in Jupyterlab Notebooks and RStudio on Seven Bridges. The p3dn.24xlarge instance has 1800GB SSD, 96vCPUs, 768GB RAM, and 8 GPUs. These higher memory cards enable machine learning training on large 3D images and high-performance computing applications.\

* **Data Cruncher Interactive Analyses:** Seven Bridges now features a “[Data Cruncher Interactive Analyses](https://sb-biodatacatalyst.readme.io/docs/data-cruncher-interactive-analyses)” public project, found in the list of public projects on the top navigation bar of the platform, with example analyses to help users interpret results from secondary analysis. The project has eight separate analyses - three in RStudio and five in Jupyterlab Notebooks - including one on VCF visualization and one on structural variant analysis. Read the [blog post](https://www.sevenbridges.com/blog-data-cruncher-interactive-analysis/).\

* **Launch Dockstore workflows in Seven Bridges:** Users can now find CWL workflows in Dockstore and launch them in the Seven Bridges workspace environment.\

* **Export large PFBs from Gen3 to Terra:** Users can now export large PFB (Portable Format for Bioinformatics) files from Gen3 (e.g. synthetic cohort files from multiple groups) to Terra. New backend systems now automatically parse files more efficiently.\

* **Automatic syncing with GitHub apps:** Dockstore now[ automatically updates your workflows](https://docs.dockstore.org/en/develop/getting-started/github-apps/github-apps.html) with any changes you make to your linked GitHub repository.\

* **Link ORCID iDs to published workflows:** Users can now link their[ ORCID iDs](https://orcid.org/) to their Dockstore accounts, and make iDs visible via their organizations, and in workflows and tools they have starred. Users searching Dockstore’s catalog will be able to associate workflows you contribute with scientific publications.\

* **GA4GH TRS Support:** Dockstore now implements the [GA4GH Tool Registry Service](https://github.com/ga4gh/tool-registry-service-schemas) (TRS) v2 standard. The goal of the TRS API is to provide a standardized way to describe the availability of tools and workflows.\

* **Transfer datasets to Jupyter Notebooks with Query Id:** Users that query the PIC-SURE UI and apply filters to create datasets can submit their query ID to the PIC-SURE client library via an R or Python[ Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/Access-to-Data-using-PIC-SURE-API/tree/master/NHLBI_BioData_Catalyst) and do not need to re-build the query manually.\

* **Data Tree Optimizations:** The PIC-SURE data tree has been optimized to show users only the studies they have been authorized to see and rendered more efficiently to allow users to select studies faster.\

* **Export data dictionary of clinical variables:**[ R and Python Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/Access-to-Data-using-PIC-SURE-API/tree/master/NHLBI_BioData_Catalyst) are now available that provide directions on exporting the full data dictionary of all clinical variables to a CSV via PIC-SURE.
