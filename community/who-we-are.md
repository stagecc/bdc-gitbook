# Who We Are

**Our Culture:**\
\
Though the primary goal of the BDC project is to build a data science ecosystem, at its core, this is a people-centric endeavor. BDC is also building a _**community of practice**_ working collaboratively to solve technical and scientific challenges in biomedical science.

**Principal Investigators (PIs):**

* **Stan Ahalt**, PI RENCI (Coordination Center)
* **Rebecca Boyles**, Co-PI RTI (Coordination Center)
* **Paul Avillach**, PI HMS (Team Carbon)&#x20;
* **Kira Bradford**, Co-PI RENCI (Team Helium)
* **Steve Cox**, Co-PI RENCI (Team Helium)
* **Brandi Davis-Dusenbery**, PI Seven Bridges (Team Xenon)&#x20;
* **Robert Grossman**, PI UChicago (Team Calcium)
* **Ashok Krishnamurthy**, PI RENCI (Team Helium )
* **Benedict Paten**, PI UCSC (Team Calcium)
* **Anthony Philippakis**, PI Broad Institute (Team Calcium)

Note: BDC collaboration is organized around teams based on elements in the periodic table. There are additional modes of collaboration in BDC including Tiger Teams, Working Groups, Steering Committee, and Publications.
