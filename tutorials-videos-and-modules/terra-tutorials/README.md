# Terra Tutorials

## **Onboarding Webinars**

For the latest training webinars, view the recordings of our [first onboarding webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhdD72BKo8g) - with a data-focused [agenda](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360058701831) - and our [second onboarding webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL9s4_zoB9I) - with an [agenda](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360059355151) covering more advanced workflow concepts such as configuration and WDL scripts.

## End-to-End Workspace-Based Tutorials

These hands-on tutorials cover the full flow of selecting data in Gen3, then handing off that data to Terra for analysis.

## PIC-SURE Tutorials in Terra

These workspaces hit the PIC-SURE API that offers search features for controlled-access data from BDC. You can query studies and subset based on patients matching specified criteria, as well as retrieve a cohort that has been created using the [PIC-SURE interface](https://picsure.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/).&#x20;

* [PIC-SURE Tutorials in R](https://terra.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/#workspaces/biodata-catalyst/BioData%20Catalyst%20PIC-SURE%20API%20R%20Examples)
* [PIC-SURE API Tutorials in Python](https://terra.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/#workspaces/biodata-catalyst/BioData%20Catalyst%20PIC-SURE%20API%20Python%20examples)

## Additional Tutorial Resources

These tutorials often use Terraâ€™s data model. If you would like to use Gen3 data with these examples, we suggest that you begin with [Getting Started with Gen3 Data on Terra](https://terra.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/#workspaces/fc-product-demo/BioDataCatalyst-Gen3-data-on-Terra-Tutorial), which can help you transform graph-structured data into a data model easier to use with our entire suite of tutorials.
